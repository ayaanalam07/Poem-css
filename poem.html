        Bravo, hooray! , , , it hooked my heart amazingly,
        <br /><br />
        A mail links popped-up on my search out of the blue,<br>
        Seeing with my two eyes rolling and open wide,<br> no it can't be,
        Copy paste poetry? ? ?<br> Can't call it your own piece,
        Not a genuine poet;<br> with false charade and intelligence.
        <br /><br />
        Copy paste poetry lines from the internet search out,<br>
        Words are flowery so as lines are always with doubt,<br>
        Lies behind the copy paste poems, it gains distrust,<br>
        Craft your poem with honesty and integrity, please do my dear poet.</p></b>
